        <p>
          I am seeking a position where I can further develop my skills in this
          highly sought-after industry. I have a portfolio of projects that I
          have created that can be viewed on my GitHub at
          https://github.com/MichaelThomas0721. Additionally, I have personally
          designed, developed, and deployed a website using Vercel's edge
          network. You can view it along with the source code at
          http://michaelthomastech.ca/. I am very eager to learn new and
          exciting tools, processes, and best practices in use in todayâ€™s
          fast-paced market. I believe that I can bring youthful exuberance, a
          creative approach, and a willingness to learn to a team in your
          organization. My education, my creative personality, and my eagerness
          to learn would make me a valuable asset to your team.
